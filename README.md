# holbertonschool-web_react

A collection of small exercises for practicing **TypeScript fundamentals** in a Webpack workflow, including interfaces, classes, DOM manipulation, and more.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without relying on Google):

- Basic types in TypeScript
- Interfaces, classes, and functions
- How to work with the DOM using TypeScript
- Generic types
- How to use namespaces
- How to merge declarations
- How to use an ambient namespace to import an external library
- Basic nominal typing with TypeScript

## Repo Structure

This repository is organized by topic and task.

- [TypeScript/task_0](TypeScript/task_0) – Intro TypeScript + DOM rendering with Webpack
- [TypeScript/task_1](TypeScript/task_1) – Interfaces, extension (e.g. `Teacher` → `Directors`), classes

Each task is designed to be built/run independently.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm

## Getting Started (per task)

From a given task folder (example: `TypeScript/task_1`):

1. Install dependencies

	`npm install`

2. Build the project

	`npm run build`

3. Run the dev server (if configured)

	`npm run start-dev`

## Notes

- These tasks are intentionally small and focused; most of the learning happens by iterating on types and letting the compiler guide you.
- If you see a message like “No type errors found.” during a build, that means type-checking is passing.
